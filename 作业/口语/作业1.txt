Ok, I don't subscribe with this statement. Maybe people prefer to approve studying the second language as early as they can. Coincidentally, I read a research about it recently. In this paper, the author point out the statement that, when you are a little boy and even you can't speak your mother tongue fluently, the second language will distract you and make your speech capability couldn't support your thinking and logical ability. I don't mean that it is hazardous for us to learn the second language. Indeed, multilingual users usually enjoy the broad vision and internationalization consciousness. In summary, the best time to studying second language is you can thing independently. So I disagree with this statement.
