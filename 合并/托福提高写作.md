[独立主格]__many a boy__ likes... 也表达许多的意思A candidates for B ... A可能是...It is thought that count 思想很重要I like apple, however, she likes bananas. 此句错误，副词不能连接两个句子[连词可以，可以用... , but, ...]any other + 单数a few 肯定/few 否定#### 动词表达 --> 名次表达eg：> * benefit    v./n. 及物动词> * of benefit   =   beneficial> * do harm to cultivate  ==  do harm to the cultivation of ...#### 定语从句 作为 非谓语动词（现在分词，过去分词）关系代词 + be --> 都省略关系代词 + v. --> v+ing> *  who beats someone..> *  who is beating someone ..==> beating someone..> *  who has beaten ...==> having beaten ...#### 句式多样性> *  分词作结果状语 He did his homework carelessly,making many mistakes.　　　伴随状语 You sat there, listening to music.####多用近义词> * threaten --> `pose a threat to`> * visit --> `pay visit to`> * fact --> reality> * get --> acquire ,achieve(goal,dream) ,obtain/attain , gain ,secure ,procure ,reap> * field --> domain#### 简单句主+谓[谓语不及物]      系动词：be动词，5个感官动词主+系+表主+谓+宾双宾语 (I give her[直宾] a ring[间宾])主+谓[谓语及物]+宾+宾补 (I make you happy[宾补])a girl comesshe is beautifulI love her[I love错误]#### 双重否点There is no denying that...It cannot be denied thatIt is undeniable thatNo one can deny that#### 伴随状语you sat there and listened to meyou sat there, listening to me#### 活用名词A threanten B __==>__ A __pose a threat__ to BA is __of importance__ to B#### 强调句[谓语动词不能强调]it is + 强调部分 + that == who + 剩下部分> self-study saves time and energy> ==>it is self-study that saves time and energy> it is XU who loves XH> it is XH who XU loves> it is thought that counts [思想很重要]#### 多用否定的否定> money is the most important thing> ==>nothing is more important than money>

work that ....>> I seldom have breakfast> seldom do I have breakfast>> I have never been to BJ> never have I been to BJ>> we should not ignore...> by no means should we ignore ...>> not until I began to make money did I realize the hardship#### only> not only is tack intelligent , but also he is hard working == industrious == assiduous == diligent>> only + 名词短语/副词/句子 + 部分倒装> only in this way can you learn....>> he turn up yesterday> not until yesterday did he turn up> it was not until yesterday that...翻译：“只有禁止使用...”，__缺少主语__，似乎只能变被动，但是我们可以 __加by__only __by__ banning the use of disposable products...[只有禁止使用一次产品...]#### 虚拟语气> if you were to buy a new car> were you to buy a new car_注意：过去虚拟，用过去完成时_#### 插入语__举例式：__{such as, like, say__eg：__Nature resource, __like charcoal and gasoline__, are nonrenewable,__Actually__, I am ugly.}__副词:__{However, I think she is beautiful.__==>__ I think, __however(紧跟主语)__, she is beautiful.Frankly, tourism ...__==>__ Tourism, frankly, ...}__形容词短语：__{Needness to say, I am ugly.}__介词短语：__{in fact, in a sense}__不定式：__{to tell the truth, to sum up ...__eg：__The harm of drug abuse, to tell the truth, ...}#### 独立主格After the meeting was over, I want home. __==>__ The meeting over, ...“独立主格结构”在句中的功能就相当于一个带有自己主语的状语从句。众所周知非限制性从句通常以主句的某一成分作为自己的逻辑主语，从而依附于主句。而有些非限制性从句和无动词从句带有自己的主语，在结构上与主句不发生关系，因此成为独立主格结构。其实，虽然叫做独立主格结构，并不是真正的独立，它还是一种从属分句，在句中有多种作用。如：表原因、表条件、表方式、表伴随、表时间等，在句中通常起状语作用。有时还可以做定语 。独立主格结构主要用于描绘性文字中，其作用相当于一个状语从句，常用来表示时间、原因、条件、行为方式或伴随情况等。例如：* 表示时间The meeting being over, all of us went home. 开完会后我们都回家了。the meeting being over相当于when the meeting was overHer work done, she sat down for a cup of tea. 她干完了活，坐下来喝茶。her work done相当于when her work was done* 表示条件The condition being favorable, he may succeed. 若条件有利，他或许能成功。the condition being favorable相当于If the condition is favorable* 表示原因There being no taxis, we had to walk. 没有出租车，我们只好步行。There being no taxis相当于Since there was no taxis,He wrapped her up with great care, the night being dark and frosty. 夜又黑又冷，所以他把她裹得严严实实的。the night being dark and frosty相当于as the night was dark and frosty* 表示伴随情况Almost all metals are good conductors, silver being the best of all. 几乎所有的金属都是良导体，而银则是最好的导体。(=Almost all metals are good conductors, and silver is the best of all.)* 表示补充说明We redoubled our efforts, each man working like two. 我们加倍努力，一个人干两个人的活。####多种写法交替we predict that __<==>__ it is predicted that####替换思维禁止燃烧->禁止消耗->ban the consumption of####善用副词：I am healthy physically and mentally.__==>__ Smoking is harmful physically.####无主语变被动To improve air quality, we should reduce "the use of private car".__==>__..., "the use of private car" should be reduced.主语从句> what......is......双重否定> never without> never fail to do>> it is common that> it is not uncommon that>> everyone like money> there is hardly a person who doesn't like money------### 重点语法定语：...__的__，全是修饰名词的，其 __限定__作用副词是用来修饰动词的国家大写[eg：China正确，china错误]the + 形容词，表示一类人，[the elderly（注意是形容词）老年人]；seniors 老年人cause 做名词表原因__A__ as well as B  就A原则__插入语是就近原则！！__不要写缩写，但是cannot需要连起来any other student 不是students![any 表示任何用单数]many a + 单数 + 第三人称V.many a 单数 + 谓语动词（单）`eg：many a boy likes playing`as well as　只看前面的主语[A as well as B are（错 应为 is）,the old is（错 应为 are）　　]####定语: 修饰限定一个名词1.adj.2.n. / 数词3.分词 (定语从句的优化)4.介词短语 The book _**on the desk**_ is red.5.副词 Students _**here**_ are hard-working.6.动名词 a _**walking**_ stick7.动词不定式 The book _**to be published**_ will be popular.------### 词汇#### 专业表述|中文|英文||:--|:--||CO2排放 |emissions of carbon dioxide||臭氧层空洞|
