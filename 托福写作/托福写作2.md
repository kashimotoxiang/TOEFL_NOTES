## 注意事项
1. 不使用"can't"，使用"cannot"
2. mounting + 抽象名词 （越来越...）
3. however 不定连词 是副词！
4. as well as　只看前面的主语
{　　　 A as well as B are（错 应为 is）
　　　　the old is（错 应为 are）　　　　 }
5.live in（错）/on（对）/off（对） campus

------
## 技巧
### 没有主语就翻译成被动

------
### 强调句[谓语动词不能强调]
it is + 强调部分 + that == who + 剩下部分
> self-study saves time and energy
> ==>it is self-study that saves time and energy
> it is XU who loves XH
> it is XH who XU loves
> it is thought that counts [思想很重要]

------
### 多用否定的否定
> money is the most important thing
> ==>nothing is more important than money
> it is not until yesterday that he turn up

### 部分倒装
> So alluring are computer games that.....
> XH is so beautiful that she remains single
>
> XM is so hard that she forgot lunch
> so hard did XM work that ....
>
> I seldom have breakfast
> seldom do I have breakfast
>
> I have never been to BJ
> never have I been to BJ
>
> we should not ignore...
> by no means should we ignore ...
>
> not until I began to make money did I realize the hardship

### only
> not only is tack intelligent , but also he is hard working == industrious == assiduous == diligent
>
> only + 名词短语/副词/句子 + 部分倒装
> only in this way can you learn....
>
> he turn up yesterday
> not until yesterday did he turn up
> it was not until yesterday that...

翻译：“只有禁止使用...”，__缺少主语__，似乎只能变被动，但是我们可以 __加by__
only __by__ banning the use of disposable products...[只有禁止使用一次产品...]

### 虚拟语气
> if you were to buy a new car
> were you to buy a new car

_注意：过去虚拟，用过去完成时_
