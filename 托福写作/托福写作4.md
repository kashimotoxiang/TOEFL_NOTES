##写作技巧
#### 避免以为用There be 开头
 There are more and more people who realize the close connection between energy and population.
 __==>__ The close connection between energy and population is increasingly recognized.

#### 避免一味用People, I ,We 等人物主语开头
 近100万中国人在过去的15年里去过了美国.
 __==>__The past 15 years brought almost one million Chinese to United States.

#### 长短句恰当使用
 * 前后有逻辑关系的两句话,短句变长句
  Lies do harm to those who are being told lies.Lies also do harm to those who tell them. = __==>__
  Not only do lies do harm to those who are being told lies but also do harm to those who tell them.
 * 臃肿的长句应精炼句子结构
  His father, _**(who is)**_ a salesman, became a millionaire overnight. 其中可把who is 省略,句子又非限制性定语从句变为同位语.

#### 主动变被动
 * 不需要体现动作的执行者
  We should pay more attention to ....
   __==>__  More attention should be paid to ...
 * 需要强调动作的承受者
  The employees elected Mr.Li chairman of the committee last week.
   __==>__ Mr.Li was elected chairman of the committee by the employees last week.
